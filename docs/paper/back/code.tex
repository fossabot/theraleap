\chapter{Source Code \& Deployment}
\label{app:code}
The Source Code Repository, including the System implementation and this documentation is released on GitHub, and accessible to the general public through the URL \texttt{\url{https://github.com/talkdirty/theraleap}}.

Furthermore, the System is deployed and accessible to the general public on the deployment platform Github Pages under the URL \texttt{\url{https://talkdirty.github.io/theraleap/}}. The Web page will install a Service Worker upon first visit on supporting (recent) Browsers. Thus, once all pages of the Frontend have been retrieved once, the System is able to operate even when offline.
